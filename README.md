# Voice-to-Notes Web App

This project is built in **VS Code** and has three main components:  

1. **`ru.py`** – Backend code  
2. **`api.env`** – Add your Gemini API key here  
3. **`templates/index.html`** – Frontend interface  

## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.  
2. Run the **backend** (`ru.py`) to start the server.  
3. Open the **`index.html`** file in the `templates` folder to access the frontend.  
4. Interact with the frontend to **record audio, get live transcription, and generate summarized notes**.
